# Project setup guide

This guide will help you set up your project structure and dependency manager. To define the project structure, we will use the [cookiecutter data science template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). This template is a good starting point for your project, as it provides a well-organized structure and best practices for data science projects.

We will use uv as the dependency manager for our project. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a lightweight dependency manager that uses the `pyproject.toml` file to manage project dependencies. It is a good alternative to `pip` and `conda` for managing Python dependencies in data science projects.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Cookiecutter Python package
- Poetry Python package
- Git
- GitHub account

## Steps
1. Install uv:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Refer to the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for other installation options, shell completions, and more.

2. Install Cookiecutter as a tool using uv:
    ```bash
    uv tool install cookiecutter-data-science
    ```
    This will install Cookiecutter in an isolated environment using uv.

3. Create a new project using the cookiecutter data science template:
    ```bash
    # From the parent directory where you want to create the project
    ccds
    ```

    Follow the prompts to create your project. You can choose the default options or customize them according to your needs. Since we will be using uv we will select `none` for the `environment_manager` option. In addition, uv stores the list of dependencies installed inside the `pyproject.toml` file. Hence, we will remove the `requirements.txt` file generated by cookicutter. Since we will be managing our dependencies, we will also select `none` for the `pydata_packages` option.

    For a complete description of the options, refer to the [cookiecutter data science documentation](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/all-options/).

4. Change to the project directory and remove the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    rm requirements.txt
    ```
    Replace `project-name` with the name of your project.

7. Add basic project dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` file:
    ```bash
    uv add pandas numpy scikit-learn
    ```
    This will install the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` packages and add them as project dependencies.
    If this is the first time adding a dependency to the project, uv will create a new virtual environment at `./.venv` and install the specified packages.

8. Add basic development dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` file:
    ```bash
    uv add --dev ruff pytest
    ```
    This will install the `ruff`, and `pytest` packages and add them as development dependencies to the project.

9. Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository):

10. Initialize a new Git repository in the project directory:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
11. Add the project files to the Git repository:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
12. Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
13. Add the remote repository URL:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin url-to-remote-repository
    ```
    Replace `url-to-remote-repository` with the URL of the remote repository you created in step 7.

14. Push the changes to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin branch-name
    ```
    This will push the changes to the `branch-name` branch of the remote repository.
    By default, newer versions of git set the initial default branch to `main`. Older versions use the branch name `master`. **Make sure your local and remote branches have the same name.**

    > **Note:** If git requests authentication, you need to provide your GitHub username and a personal access token as the password. Refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for more information on creating a personal access token. A **recommended** alternative is to use SSH for authentication. Refer to the [GitHub SSH documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for more information on setting up SSH authentication.

Your project is now set up with the project structure and dependency manager. You can start working on your project by adding code, data, and other project-specific files to the project directory. Make sure to follow best practices for project organization and version control to ensure reproducibility and collaboration.
